The Game
Lights Out is a logic/puzzle game, played on a gird of individual lights, which can either be lit or unlit. The puzzle is won when when all of the lights are turned off.

You can click on a cell to toggle that light — but it also toggles the light above it, to the left of it, to the right of it, and below it. (Cells on an edge or in the corner won’t flip as many lights, since they are missing some neighbors).

We’ll give you a component design further down, but thinking about the requirements and what components/state/props would be needed will help you learn the skills to design applications out of components.

= STOP = DRAW YOUR DESIGN OUT before reading further.

Code
This game will be built from three components: (hover to view)


When the game is won, the board should not be shown, but a simple “You Won” message should show in its place.

A small amount of code is provided, but there are lots of places where you’ll need to write code to get the game functional.
